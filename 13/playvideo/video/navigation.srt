00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,666
Welcome to the Records Management simulation.

2
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:05,099
This short video will explain the different

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,000
sections and navigational buttons

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,166
in this simulation.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,266
Each job also has specific directions and a video

6
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,799
walkthrough that will give you more details about

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
how to complete that job.

8
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,599
The How to Navigate records management video

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,866
that you are watching now,

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,933
describes the basic sections,

11
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,599
screens and buttons in this simulation.

12
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,166
The Overview of Auric Systems, Inc.

13
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,632
screen gives you background

14
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:31,066
information about the company in this simulation.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,532
Depending on what job you are working in,

16
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,999
you will see either

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,200
“Overview of Jobs 1 through 4”

18
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:41,166
or “Overview of Jobs 5 through 13.”

19
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,599
The “Overview of Jobs 1 through 4” screen

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,433
gives you information about your role

21
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:47,399
in Auric Systems

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,833
and how to complete these first four jobs.

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,333
The Overview screen for Jobs 5 through 13

24
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,133
provides information about working with

25
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,999
correspondence in jobs 5 through 13.

26
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,099
Each job’s landing page has a Directions screen

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,566
specific to that job.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,866
This screen gives you an overview of what

29
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,666
you will be doing in a specific job.

30
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,232
The video walkthrough for each job gives

31
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,333
detailed instructions on how to navigate

32
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,099
that job,

33
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:13,666
and how to complete the steps

34
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,166
in each task of that job.

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,066
After you have watched the video,

36
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,833
click the START JOB button.

37
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,166
For most jobs,

38
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,299
this will take you directly

39
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,600
to the main task screen for that job.

40
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,932
Some of the later jobs have more complicated

41
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:26,799
navigation,

42
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,199
with more than one main task screen

43
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,566
or with additional information provided

44
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:33,732
before you reach the main task screen.

45
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:34,899
For example,

46
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,666
this is the General Information

47
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,899
screen for Job 10.

48
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,332
Again, the Video Walkthrough for each job

49
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,866
will explain any navigation

50
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:44,599
that is specific to that job.

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,100
Clicking the Records Management logo

52
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,900
brings you back to the landing page

53
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,233
for the job you are working on.

54
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,066
When you start the job again,

55
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,033
you will return to where you left off.

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,233
Audio buttons allow you to play,

57
00:01:59,066 --> 00:01:59,666
pause,

58
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,066
or replay the text on any screen.

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,766
On the main task screen, the audio buttons allow

60
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:11,332
you to play, pause, or replay the

61
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,133
instructions at the top of the screen.

62
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,199
The progress bar at the bottom of the main task

63
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,300
screen tracks how far along you are in the job.

64
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,166
Now let’s review the main tabs at the bottom of

65
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,799
the screen and what they mean.

66
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,800
The sitemap tab gives you a quick overall view

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
of the different components of the job.

68
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,999
The help tab provides basic guidance

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,566
on using the simulation.

70
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:36,599
The rules tab provides reference material to help

71
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,066
you complete the job,

72
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,200
including alphabetic filing Rules

73
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,066
1 through 10 and Cross-Referencing Rules.

74
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,699
The exit tab allows you to leave the simulation

75
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,600
at any time.

76
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:48,999
When you return,

77
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,666
the simulation will remember where you left off

78
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,266
and return you to your place.

79
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,133
Once you have completed a job,

80
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,000
you can submit your work for grading

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,600
by clicking the Finish and Submit button.

82
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,633
The Finish and Submit button is inactive

83
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:05,233
until you have filed all of the records in the job.

84
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,433
Before you submit your work

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,266
you are encouraged to take advantage of the

86
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,232
“Review Answers” button.

87
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,366
This brings you back to the main task screen

88
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,399
and allows you to review or change

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,100
your answers.

90
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:18,066
Then,

91
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,899
after you have reviewed your answers,

92
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,866
click “Finish and Submit” again.

93
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:22,632
When you are ready,

94
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,932
submit your final answers for scoring

95
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,833
by clicking on the “Submit” button.

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,700
After you have submitted your work,

97
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,766
you will be able to review your score

98
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,166
and the time it took you to complete the simulation.

99
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,633
Clicking on the

100
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,999
“Check Answers” button

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,333
allows you to look at a detailed analysis

102
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,399
of your answers,

103
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,732
so you can see how your score was calculated.

104
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,133
After you are done reviewing your score,

105
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,000
click the “Click Here to Close” button

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,933
to close out of the completed job.
