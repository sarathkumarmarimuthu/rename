Click on the primary unit, or key unit, to underline it

37
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,233

43
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
click on any underlined or numbered unit again

44
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,200
to remove the number from that unit

45
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,799
and all units that follow it.

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Continue to number the units on all

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,266
cards until you have completed the set

48
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,732

Once you have finished coding

55
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,300
drag and drop each card into the correct folder

56
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,200
for a rough sort

57
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,966
The “Finish & Submit” button will remain disabled

58
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,766
until all records have been filed within folders

59
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:17,332
Next, open each folder to perform a

60
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,299
fine sort of the cards in that folder

61
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,866

to drag it into the correct order

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,133
Note that the number above each card

66
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,333
indicates the current order of the cards

67
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,266
For a zoomed-in view of the card

68
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,566
click anywhere on the card

69
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:36,799

00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,099
click the close button

71
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:40,599
If you notice while you are sorting that you have

72
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,666
made a coding or filing error

73
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,333
click the blue arrow in the corner of the card

74
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,433
This will return the card back

75
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,866

76
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,166
and you can fix the error and re-file

77
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,066
