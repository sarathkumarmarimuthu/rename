00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.666
Welcome to the Records Management simulation.

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.099
This short video will explain the different

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.000
sections and navigational buttons

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.166
in this simulation.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.266
Each job also has specific directions and a video

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.799
walkthrough that will give you more details about

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.200
how to complete that job.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.599
The How to Navigate records management video

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.866
that you are watching now,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.933
describes the basic sections,

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.599
screens and buttons in this simulation.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.166
The Overview of Auric Systems, Inc.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.632
screen gives you background

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.066
information about the company in this simulation.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.532
Depending on what job you are working in,

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:35.999
you will see either

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.200
“Overview of Jobs 1 through 4”

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:41.166
or “Overview of Jobs 5 through 13.”

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.599
The “Overview of Jobs 1 through 4” screen

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.433
gives you information about your role

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:47.399
in Auric Systems

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.833
and how to complete these first four jobs.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.333
The Overview screen for Jobs 5 through 13

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.133
provides information about working with

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.999
correspondence in jobs 5 through 13.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.099
Each job’s landing page has a Directions screen

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.566
specific to that job.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.866
This screen gives you an overview of what

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.666
you will be doing in a specific job.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.232
The video walkthrough for each job gives

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.333
detailed instructions on how to navigate

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.099
that job,

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:13.666
and how to complete the steps

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.166
in each task of that job.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.066
After you have watched the video,

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.833
click the START JOB button.

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.166
For most jobs,

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.299
this will take you directly

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.600
to the main task screen for that job.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.932
Some of the later jobs have more complicated

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:26.799
navigation,

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.199
with more than one main task screen

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.566
or with additional information provided

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.732
before you reach the main task screen.

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:34.899
For example,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.666
this is the General Information

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.899
screen for Job 10.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.332
Again, the Video Walkthrough for each job

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.866
will explain any navigation

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.599
that is specific to that job.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.100
Clicking the Records Management logo

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.900
brings you back to the landing page

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.233
for the job you are working on.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.066
When you start the job again,

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:54.033
you will return to where you left off.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.233
Audio buttons allow you to play,

00:01:59.066 --> 00:01:59.666
pause,

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:04.066
or replay the text on any screen.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.766
On the main task screen, the audio buttons allow

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:11.332
you to play, pause, or replay the

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.133
instructions at the top of the screen.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.199
The progress bar at the bottom of the main task

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.300
screen tracks how far along you are in the job.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.166
Now let’s review the main tabs at the bottom of

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.799
the screen and what they mean.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.800
The sitemap tab gives you a quick overall view

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.600
of the different components of the job.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:30.999
The help tab provides basic guidance

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.566
on using the simulation.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.599
The rules tab provides reference material to help

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.066
you complete the job,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.200
including alphabetic filing Rules

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.066
1 through 10 and Cross-Referencing Rules.

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:46.699
The exit tab allows you to leave the simulation

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.600
at any time.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:48.999
When you return,

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.666
the simulation will remember where you left off

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:53.266
and return you to your place.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.133
Once you have completed a job,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.000
you can submit your work for grading

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.600
by clicking the Finish and Submit button.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.633
The Finish and Submit button is inactive

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:05.233
until you have filed all of the records in the job.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.433
Before you submit your work

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.266
you are encouraged to take advantage of the

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.232
“Review Answers” button.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.366
This brings you back to the main task screen

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.399
and allows you to review or change

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.100
your answers.

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:18.066
Then,

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.899
after you have reviewed your answers,

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.866
click “Finish and Submit” again.

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:22.632
When you are ready,

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.932
submit your final answers for scoring

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:26.833
by clicking on the “Submit” button.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.700
After you have submitted your work,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.766
you will be able to review your score

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:33.166
and the time it took you to complete the simulation.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.633
Clicking on the

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:35.999
“Check Answers” button

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.333
allows you to look at a detailed analysis

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:39.399
of your answers,

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:41.732
so you can see how your score was calculated.

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:44.133
After you are done reviewing your score,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.000
click the “Click Here to Close” button

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.933
